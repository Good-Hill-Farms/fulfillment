# üçç AI-Powered Fulfillment Assistant ‚Äì README

This project is a smart inventory + order matching dashboard built with Streamlit and Python. It helps match customer fruit orders to available warehouse inventory using:

* Uploaded CSVs
* Predefined rules (warehouse zones, shipping, SKU mappings)
* Editable dashboards with AG Grid
* Exportable results

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note:** This system is used for real operational decisions ‚Äî no default values should be used. Every input must be explicitly defined. Any missing or placeholder values may lead to incorrect fulfillment logic.

## üìÇ Requirements Overview
Here‚Äôs an additional section you can append to your **üçç AI-Powered Fulfillment Assistant ‚Äì README** to incorporate the flow from your diagram and explain the phased logic steps.

## üîÅ Fulfillment Workflow Logic

This assistant follows a multi-step operational flow to manage and push orders based on conditions, priority, and warehouse zones.

### ü™ú Fulfillment Flow Steps

| Step             | Action                                     | Description                                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tool Post Upload | ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upload `orders.csv` and `inventory.csv` | Data is parsed and stored with a unique batch ID for traceability.   |
| Step 1           | ‚úÖ Push all **priority P1** orders          | Orders tagged as high-priority are processed and pushed immediately. |
| Step 2           | üîÑ Adjust `vbox` for remaining orders      | Orders not in P1 are re-evaluated and routed using fallback logic.   |
| Step 3           | üöö Push **California orders** separately   | Specific rule-based routing for California zip codes is applied.     |

## üß† v1 System Logic

| Module                        | Purpose                                                                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `condition states management` | Tracks order statuses and conditions (e.g. zip, bundle type, priority).        |
| `programmatic rules engine`   | Applies fulfillment rules for quantity, zone, fallback, etc.                   |
| `LLM layer`                   | Optional AI layer to assist operators with questions and fulfillment guidance. |

## üß™ Manual + Smart Pushes

* You can selectively **push orders that match certain conditions** (e.g., zip, tags, rules).
* Optionally **show stats and highlight any matching issues** before pushing.

This flow ensures safe batch handling, priority awareness, and clarity in rule execution.

### üîß Files Required for the App to Function:

#### 1. `orders.csv`

* Contains customer order line items
* Required fields:

  * `order id`
  * `Shipping: Zip`
  * SKU columns (like `f.mangosteen-2lb`, etc.)
  * May contain **bundles** or **singular items**

#### 2. `inventory.csv`

* Contains all SKUs available in each warehouse
* Columns required:

  * `WarehouseName` (Normalize: treat `Moorpark` and `Oxnard` as same)
  * `Sku`
  * `AvailableQty`
  * `Oxnard` and `Wheeling` columns with picklist SKUs and balances

#### 3. `sku_mappings.json`

* Maps all SKUs in orders to picklist SKUs in inventory
* Includes:

  * `picklist_sku`
  * `actualqty`
  * `Total_Pick_Weight`
  * `Pick_Type`
  * Information about whether a SKU is part of a **bundle** or a **singular item**
  * Must support **manual updates** and **custom entries** via the dashboard

#### 4. `shipping_zones.json`

* Maps `zip_prefix` ‚Üí `zone` per warehouse
* Used for warehouse prioritization logic
* Must support adding new `zip_prefix` and editing warehouse assignments

#### 5. `delivery_services.json`

* Maps destination zip prefix ‚Üí shipping method and origin warehouse
* Can be used to calculate delivery days or fallback warehouse
* Should be editable to reflect carrier/service updates

## ‚úÖ Features

* Upload and analyze order/inventory files
* Match orders to fulfillment center inventory
* Track shortages and produce warning CSVs
* Use distance logic (zone/zip) to prioritize fulfillment
* Recognize **bundles** vs **singular items**
* Edit and recalculate in dashboard with AgGrid
* Export final matched fulfillment plan
* ‚öôÔ∏è Fully editable SKU mappings, fulfillment centers, and zone logic from the interface

---

## üß† Matching Logic (WIP/Planned)

### 1. Normalize Warehouse Names

```python
if "moorpark" in warehouse.lower() or "oxnard" in warehouse.lower():
    warehouse = 'Oxnard'
elif "wheeling" in warehouse.lower():
    warehouse = 'Wheeling'
```

### 2. For each order line:

* Identify if the line is a **bundle** or **singular** using SKU mapping
* Look up SKU in `sku_mappings.json`
* Determine required quantity from order
* Find available quantity in prioritized warehouses (based on shipping zone logic)
* Assign fulfillment warehouse
* Deduct quantity
* Log shortages if inventory insufficient

### 3. Export Results

* Fulfillment plan (with warehouse assignment)
* Shortage report if needed

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Future Rules & Settings

* Warehouse fallback logic
* Priority orders
* Bundle awareness and composition validation
* Partial fill or not
* SLA/delivery days calculator
* Editable interface for SKU mappings, zones, and fulfillment rules

---

## ‚úÖ Inventory Columns To Use

From `inventory.csv`, use:

* `WarehouseName`
* `Sku`
* `AvailableQty`
* `Oxnard`, `Wheeling` SKU & quantity columns (e.g., `blood_orange-01x04`, `peach-22x64`, etc.)

---

## üìå Next Steps

* [ ] Implement SKU matching and deduction logic
* [ ] Integrate shipping zone-based prioritization
* [ ] Add logic to detect and decompose bundles
* [ ] Improve UI with manual override tools
* [ ] Export fulfillment assignments cleanly
* [ ] Add editable UI for SKU mappings, ZIP logic, fulfillment centers
* [ ] Optional: integrate with Airtable or Google Sheets
